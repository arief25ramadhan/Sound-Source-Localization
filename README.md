# Sound-Source Localization

This project aims to locate sound direction in both azimuth (left-right) and elevation (top-bottom) angle.
The author used four neural network architectures in performing the localization: Multi Layered Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, 
Recurrent Neural Network, and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network. The localization is formularized as classification of 15 different class/position.
A link to the dataset would be uploaded soon.
